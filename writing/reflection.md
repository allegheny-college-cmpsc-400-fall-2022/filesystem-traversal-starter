# File System Traversal

## Add Your Name Here

## Program Output

### Use five fenced code blocks to provide output from five different runs of `tree`

#### Provide the command the output for the first run of the `tree`

TODO: Provide the output that the command produces.
TODO: Make sure that you run this command from the directory that contains the `input` directory.

- `poetry run tree --input-directory input`

#### Provide the command the output for the second run of the `tree`

TODO: Provide the output that the command produces.
TODO: Make sure that you run this command from directly inside the `input` directory.

- `poetry run tree --input-directory .`

#### Provide the command the output for the third run of the `tree`

TODO: Provide the output that the command produces.
TODO: Make sure that you run this command from directly inside the `input` directory.

- `poetry run tree --input-directory dir_three`

#### Provide the command the output for the fourth run of the `tree`

TODO: Provide the output that the command produces.
TODO: Make sure that you run this command from directly inside the `input` directory.

- `poetry run tree --input-directory dir_two`

#### Provide the command the output for the fifth run of the `tree`

TODO: Provide the output that the command produces.
TODO: Make sure that you run this command from a directory that **does not** contain the `input` directory.

- `poetry run tree --input-directory input`

## Source Code

### Provide the source code that recursively traverses the file system and explain how it works

TODO: Provide a description of each key line in the provided source code.
TODO: Make sure that you describe at least five lines of source code in the fenced code block.

### Provide the source code that implements the command-line interface and explain how it works

TODO: Provide a description of each line in the following source code.
TODO: Make sure that you describe at least three lines of source code in the fenced code block.

## Professional Development

## Project Reflection

### How do the programs that you implemented connect to the content about disks drives and file systems?

TODO: Provide a one-paragraph response that answers this question in your own words.
TODO: Make sure to refer to the course schedule for details about the covered content.
TODO: Make sure to refer to the course textbook for details about the covered content.

### What was the greatest challenge that you faced when completing this project? How did you resolve it?

TODO: Provide a one-paragraph response that answers this question in your own words.

### Compared to the tool in the following link, what features does your `tree` program not provide?

Please learn more about the [exa replacement for the ls
command](https://the.exa.website/) before you answer this question about the
similarities and differences between your `tree` command and the way in which
the `exa` command can traverse the file system and display a file system tree.
