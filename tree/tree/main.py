# TODO: implement a program that can:
# --> perform a recursive traversal of a file system and collect all of the
# files and directories nested within a specified directory
# --> size all of the individual files (in a suitable size unit of measurement)
# and display those sizes in the file tree displayed in the console
#
# TODO: Refer to the README.md file for more information about the program's
# command-line arguments and the output that it is supposed to produce.
